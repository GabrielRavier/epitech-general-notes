We will rethink our project on a few things

IMPROVE

Until the 19th November

Desirability sprint #1
Desirability sprint #2
Viability sprint
Feasability sprint

Desirability

Field actions
- These are objectives to be fulfilled to increase one of the 3 objectives of design thinking

We must choose 4 objectives on each sprint
We will actually end up having to do all of them since there are only 8 objectives total

It must not be just the project lead who does everything, everyone must have their role


Notation

Points:
0: Not completed or sloppy
1: In progress with results
2: Finalized

Desirability: 8 tasks on 8
Viability: 4 tasks on 8
Feasability: 4 tasks on 8



Structure

Objectives
- Conduct a comprehensive study
- Synthesize ideas
- Working in Agile
- Work in a group
- Convince an audience

This all seems dumb and just "checkmark" activities but they should be able to get us to refocus our ideas and really understand what we do
