What's a TalkUp ? Simon will go back to that later
Hub projects, can we put an existing project into it ? Eeyup





TalkUp:

Participating in a talk is 1XP

Functioning:
- 1 Wednesday per month from 13h to 14h starting on the 26th of October

The old "one hour per month everyone shows up" format is abandonned. (no more Logitech prices lol)
Might be the end of it
